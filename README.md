# Next.js Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Next.js Learning Repository**! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering **Next.js**, a powerful React framework for building modern web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and much more.

Here, you will find:

- Practical hands-on examples
